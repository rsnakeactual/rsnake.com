RSnake built a self-healing top 100 list to keep the few hacking sites on the Internet interconnected. The issue with webrings being that when enough sites go offline the webrings tended to no longer function as a link chain due to too many gaps, whereas top 100 lists only showed sites with actual traffic flowing to them.

While at Cable &amp; Wireless America, RSnake worked with Jeremiah Grossman to create intranet port hacking &#8211; a technique by which the browser&#8217;s internal access to a network is a conduit for malicious HTML and JavaScript to attack internal resources.

                            <p>
								RSnake co-founded SecTheory LLC with James Flom in 2006 while RSnake was still at Realtor.com and shortly thereafter moved to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin%2C_Texas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin, Texas</a>&nbsp;where he continued doing Internet security research while consulting. [36] He began by attacking the authentication system at Acutrust using entropy attacks. [11] The XSS cheatsheet was built to evade filters that might prevent attackers from injecting&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Site_Scripting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cross-Site Scripting</a>. [12]<br><br>In 2008 Tom Stracener and RSnake co-presented at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEF CON</a>&nbsp;security conference in Las Vegas, NV on the topic of &#8220;Xploiting Google Gadgets: Gmalware and Beyond&#8221;. [23][44] The attack used malicious Google Gadgets to phish users and leak sensitive information. After this talk RSnake joined the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hat_Briefings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hat Briefings</a>&nbsp;speaker review board. [24]<br><br>RSnake worked on two DNS-related projects:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DNS rebinding</a>&nbsp;research[13] and the Fierce DNS enumeration tool which was capable of using brute force enumeration to identify assets of a target domain in 2009. [14] Adding to the groundswell of intranet port scanning research, RSnake introduced the concept of RFC1918 cache poisoning, which used the browser&#8217;s cache and overlapping RFC1918 space to compromise networks that an adversary would not normally have access to. [15][35]<br><br>RSnake built a denial of service tool called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slowloris (computer security)</a>&nbsp;which used partially complete HTTP requests in parallel to deny service to Apache websites. Slowloris was used during the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Iranian_presidential_election_protests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2009 Iranian presidential election protests</a>&nbsp;to take down leadership websites. [16]<br><br>Shortly thereafter, RSnake and Jeremiah Grossman co-authored a new exploit class called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clickjacking</a>&nbsp;(also sometimes referred to as Likejacking or UI redressing). The official presentation had to delay details of the exploit due to a request by Adobe to fix the vulnerability in Flash prior to public disclosure. [17][18][37][38][39][40]<br><br>RSnake and James Flom co-created Falling Rock Networks, which was a productized version of the ha.ckers.org&#8217;s hardware and software stack which heavily utilized&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Berkeley Software Distribution</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chroot</a>&nbsp;jails. [19]<br><br>In 2010 and during his time analyzing HTTPS, RSnake and Josh Sokol presented at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hat_Briefings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hat Briefings</a>&nbsp;a collection of two dozen HTTPS side-channel attacks in a presentation dubbed &#8220;HTTPS can Byte Me&#8221;. [20] Shortly thereafter, in December 2010, RSnake wrote his 1,000th blog post and officially ended his blogging on ha.ckers.org. [21] In 2012 RSnake, by way of SecTheory, was involved in the DFIR work after Anonymous hacked&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratfor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stratfor</a>. [22]<br><br>While running SecTheory with RSnake, James Flom located a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carnivore (software)</a>&nbsp;device in their network, which ultimately lead RSnake to filing a FOIA request. The CIA gave a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glomar response</a>. [25] On RSnake&#8217;s Facebook page, he said that the FBI on the other hand "said that my case file was 469 pages, of which they were going to delete 419 before they even sent it to me. That left 50 pages. Those 50 pages though, were just the boilerplate case file and every single page is 100% redacted."<br><br>SecTheory was officially handed over to James Flom in 2013 to run the company after the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subprime mortgage crisis</a>&nbsp;which had a large financial impact on the consulting practice.

[26]<br><br>During his tenure at WhiteHat, RSnake issued a warning about Anonymous having been compromised by nation states on VICE Cyberwar. [27] Subsequently, RSnake has explained how he knew that to be true in a conversation with Mike Jones on the H4unt3d Hacker podcast. [25]<br><br>RSnake began to collect and compute magic hashes which allow adversaries to utilize collisions to break into web applications when certain types of numerics are used in comparison with existing hashes which collide with the numeric representation of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zero</a>. [28]<br><br>In 2015 RSnake downloaded the North Korean&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Star_OS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Star OS</a>&nbsp;and ran tests to identify issues with the Nanera browser, which lead to the understanding that the entirety of North Korea is using&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC1918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RFC1918</a>&nbsp;address space.

[30]&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NaN</a>&nbsp;refers to &#8220;Not a Number&#8221; which potentially allows an adversary to do many different dangerous things when injected into vulnerable Python code such as privilege escalation, denial of service, incorrect comparison operations, and more.

In it, the book discusses the parallels between his friend and former business partner James Flom and the tragic murder-suicide stemming from his hallucinations and how that relates closely to hyper-intelligent AGI systems that too hallucinate.<br><br>In 2024 RSnake began the new series as part of the show called &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2aZeTHYR94&amp;list=PLzflOhc8R6fLlxlWpmIZ6KJb3ErT_-RKg">Demo Day</a>&#8221; where he began to interview vendors who wanted to deliver demos so that consumers wouldn&#8217;t have to go through long funnels before they could see if the security products worked for them or not.<br><br>Also in 2024 RSnake began the newsletter &#8220;<a href="https://rsnakereport.rsnake.com/">RSnake Report</a>&#8221; which was a geopolitical, information security, business and technology focused newsletter.

								<h3 class="h4">Sla.ckers.org Full Disclosure Stance</h3>
								<p>
									In the late 2000&#8217;s RSnake began a thread on the sla.ckers.org forum entitled &#8220;So it begins&#8221; which was a massive thread of various different cross site scripting attacks that were found in hundreds and then eventually over 1000 different websites proving how vulnerable modern web applications were. The majority of the flaws were found by RSnake himself. The thread ended up causing a backlash from a number of large companies and security vendors who were in favor of a non-disclosure policy whereby security researchers contact the companies privately and thereby making it possible to fix the issues without attackers being able to leverage the issue. RSnake&#8217;s point was that by failing to publicly disclose the issues, it made it more difficult to explain the prevalence of security flaws in modern web applications. [45]

							<div class="timeline-item">
								<h3 class="h4">Windows Help Centre Vulnerability</h3>
								<p>
									Tavis Ormandy, a Google employee, found an issue within Windows Help Centre and disclosed it publicly without going through the responsible disclosure process. On his blog, RSnake challenged Google to follow its own rules and fire Tavis Ormandy or stop requiring other hackers to follow responsible disclosure rules. This led to backlash on RSnake&#8217;s blog from the industry who felt that RSnake was unfairly calling for Tavis&#8217; termination and that the exploit was not Google sponsored despite the evidence that Tavis worked for Google and coordinated the disclosure with his manager at the time, Michał Zalewski. [32] Google eventually capitulated by starting&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Zero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Zero</a>&nbsp;which largely solved the issue of how Google dealt with 3rd party vulnerability disclosures. RSnake ultimately stopped writing on his ha.ckers.org blog and eventually shut the site down after the 1000th blog post in part due to the incident. [3]

								<h3 class="h4">Hack The Pentagon</h3>
								<p>
									In 2016 and after multiple invitations into the &#8220;Hack the Pentagon&#8221; program run by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackerOne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HackerOne</a>, RSnake was apparently almost arrested by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United States Department of Defense</a>&nbsp;for going out of scope during the reconnaissance phase of the government-sanctioned bug bounty program. The arrest never took place, presumably due to pressure from the US Digital Services on the Department of the Army to save face. This led to a change of policy that now allows hackers to safely disclose vulnerabilities that they may find in the DoD without fear of retribution. It is colloquially referred to the &#8220;see something say something&#8221; policy. [25][42]

							<div class="timeline-item">
								<h3 class="h4">Musk vs Twitter</h3>
								<p>
									In 2017, RSnake worked with an unnamed internal employee at Twitter to create a project designed to fix the perceived &#8220;bot problem&#8221; after the 2016 election. As a result of this unnamed Twitter employee&#8217;s attempt to notify the executives and fix the problem, the employee was ultimately let go by Twitter and the project concept was abandoned. Unfixed, the bot problem eventually culminated in a lawsuit following Elon Musk&#8217;s attempted takeover of Twitter, where the existence and prevalence of bots on the Twitter platform became the central issue involving the valuation of the company. [43]

							<div class="timeline-item">
								<h3 class="h4">Jan 6th Commission Report</h3>
								<p>
									In 2022, RSnake discussed with both Morgan Warstler and John Robison their involvement in discussing alternative methods of bypassing the election process with Donald Trump on November 10th, a week after the election at the Oval office. [47][48] Subsequently, The RSnake Show was referenced as background material within the Jan 6th Commission Report corroborating the evidence that Morgan Warstler was indeed in charge of the Twitter account used to admit to his visiting the Whitehouse and that states can choose their electors, overriding the popular vote. [49]

							<div class="timeline-item">
								<h3 class="h4">James Flom/Shannon Norton Murder-Suicide</h3>
								<p>
									April 27 2023, James Flom and Shannon Norton were found dead in her home, by apparent murder-suicide an estimated 4 days prior, where James shot and killed Shannon and then himself. James was RSnake&#8217;s long time best-friend and former business partner. The controversy around the tragedy was the depiction as a domestic dispute by the press and twitter commentators [50], but RSnake has come out against this characterization as it is far more likely the cause of undetected chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to repeated brain traumas and a decline causing subsequent violent auditory hallucinations.<br><br>
