Understanding user intent is the cornerstone for reducing fraud ratios in modern web applications.  From retail to government, this book covers many different realms of fraud and how to detect it at many different technical layers.  From DNS and TCP to embedded content and browser fingerprinting techniques it is possible to identify users who are most likely to become dangerous often before it actually happens.  A plethora of techniques and examples are all available to you within the <u>300+</u> pages of this book. And best of all, I've finally made it completely FREE!

          <blockquote>
          - "<b>I can tell you that it is, without a doubt, the best web security book I have ever had the pleasure to read.</b>" - David Mortman, <i>CSO - Echelon One</i><br /><br />
          - "<b>Detecting Malice is a must-read resource for anyone tasked with  protecting a website. It is incredibly detailed and comprehensive, without all the usual cruft you see filling up other books on the topic. If you have a website, have logs, and want to know what the bad  guys are trying to do to you (and trust me, we're all targets), then  this is the only resource out there to help you understand what they're doing, how to defend yourself, and how to turn the tables and  unmask your attacker. It's written in a very accessible informal style, yet still loaded with content and practical examples.</b>" - Rich Mogull, <i>CEO - Securosis</i><br /><br />
          - "<b>It approached security from a different perspective than I usually do.  As an application developer, I'm usually razor focused on what can break, how it can break, and how to prevent it.  I'd never really thought to identify suspicious users or had time to sift through logs and see the interesting and/or aberrant trends. The CSRF detection examples do a great job of illustrating how careful log analysis of strange behavior can help identify known attacks to which your site is vulnerable as well as help identify users worth watching for new attack methods.  The focus on what common attacks look like on the server rather than how they work is also useful. It's influenced what I log, how I watch logs, and how I mitigate detected attacks.</b>" - Nick Sivo, <i>CTO/Founder - Loopt</i><br /><br />

          - "<b>If you spend millions on Search Marketing or even just a few hundred dollars this book is a must read, don't let your efforts go to waste by being caught out.</b>" - David Naylor, <i>CEO - <a href="http://www.bronco.co.uk/"><span style="color:#000000">Bronco Web Design</span></a></i><br /><br />
          - "<b>"Detecting Malice" really is a fantastic opus of WebAppSec wisdom.</b>" - Chris Hoff, <i>Director, Cloud & Virtualization Solutions - Cisco</i><br /><br />
          - "<b>This book leaves the reader with the conclusion why some web-based attacks go unnoticed.  It illustrates why our current tools and techniques are not built to detect them...yet! But just wait until the web security vendors read Detecting Malice!</b>" - Quincy Jackson, <i>IT Security Manager</i><br /><br />
          - "<b>Shell out the $39 for the 300 page e-Book Detecting Malice, written by Robert Hansen (aka RSnake, on Twitter at @RSnake) and actually read it. I can't believe I'm actually endorsing a freaking e-Book, but its really that good. I don't know Robert personally, I'm not endorsing it as a favor or because I like him as a person. For all I know he eats puppies for breakfast. But his book is fantastic.</b>" - Alison Gianotto, <i>Author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000B0T13/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=marketslant-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0000B0T13"><span style="color:#000000">Professional PHP4 Web Development Solutions</span></a></i><br /><br />
          - "<b>'He does a great job of covering the landscape, talking in plain language without a lot of technical jargon and with many clear examples.... I highly recommend this book, well worth the time and money. It will stimulate your thinking and certainly raise your level of paranoia, and perhaps level of motivation, to lock things down.'</b>" - David Strom - <i>Owner - David Strom Inc.</i><br /><br />
          - "<b>'Detecing Malice' by Robert 'RSnake' Hansen is a must read for security technologists, especially incident responders attempting to deal with the constantly advancing threats to web applications.  'Detecting Malice' uses simple language to help readers build a complex technical foundation to understand the most current web attack methodologies. More importantly however, Hansen provides real-world examples of attacks and provides methods to determine the intent of an attacker from a seemingly benign piece of information. This blend of technical know-how and psycho-analysis allows the reader a rare opportunity to understand the art of web application security.</b>" - Michael Montecillo, <i>Threat Research and Intelligence Principal - IBM Security Services</i><br /><br />
          - "<b>Anyone I bring it up to first complains about the $40 eBook, but it's the best technical book I've bought in a while.</b>" - David Meier, <i>Consultant - Aeritae Consulting Group</i><br />
